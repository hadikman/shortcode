title: enable post revisions
description: You can enable post and page revisions by adding the following line before the "That's all, stop editing! Happy publishing" comment in the wp-config.php file. If the attribute is set to 'true' WordPress will store all revisions for the posts. Setting it to 'false' will deactivate revisions altogether. Finally, you can pass a positive integer to set the maximum number of stored revisions.
